# brimstone

![brimstone](imgur.com image replace me!)

My personal quest for endgame. A combination of the Kyria (https://splitkb.com/products/kyria-pcb-kit) and the Signum (http://www.troyfletcher.net/keyboard_sales.html) with laptop use and portability in mind. So Bluetooth support and low profile are my contribution.
